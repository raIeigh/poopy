If you decide to host this bot, it's recommended to be in a Unix-like environment (basically (windows subsystem for) linux)

You'll also need to install:
  - Node.JS
  - Python
  - Java
  - FFmpeg
  - ImageMagick

After everything's installed, run `build.sh`

To start the bot, run these commands in the root folder (Linux systems only):
```bash
chmod u+x start
./start <auth token> <bot token>
```
Upon executing these commands, both tokens will be stored in a file named `tokens.poo` (backup) and as environment variables.

You'll need a Discord bot token to run this app (`DEFAULT_TOKEN` and `TEST_TOKEN`), there is also a list of tokens you can set up in system variables:
  - `AUTH_TOKEN` (SET THIS TO SOMETHING RANDOM! mainly used for encrypting/decrypting messages and private tokens from people, can also be used to access private apis from the website)
  - `BOT_WEBSITE` (url if you want a website for your bot)
  - `HIVEMIND_ID` (id for your bot to participate in the hivemind. leave blank to not have any of the hivemind functionality)
  - `CLOUDAMQP_URL` (url used to send file processing queues, accessed at https://api.cloudamqp.com/console/`APP-ID`/details)
