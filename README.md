## Installation

If you wanna host this bot you'll need to install the following tools and add some to your environment variables:
  - [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
  - [Java](https://www.java.com/download/manual.jsp)
  - [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
  - [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php)
  - [G'MIC](https://gmic.eu/download.html)

You can also try and run the `install` script that corresponds to your system to do the job for you.

After everything's installed, run the `build` script to set up the binaries and dependencies.

## Getting Sharted

For the bot to authenticate, you'll need a Discord bot token (`DEFAULT_TOKEN` or `TEST_TOKEN`), and a completely random `AUTH_TOKEN` to encrypt and decrypt some data that is stored. You can easily get a Discord token by going to your application (or creating one if you haven't) in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), then going to the bot section and copying the generated token.

![Token up!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raIeigh/poopy/main/assets/image/token.png)

After retrieving your token, you can run these commands in the root folder (Linux systems only):
```bash
chmod u+x start.sh
./start <auth token> <bot token>
```
Upon executing these commands, both tokens will be stored in a file named `tokens.poo` (backup) and as environment variables.

You can also just run `node server.js` in the current folder to start him up, and optionally append the `--test` flag to it. Keep in mind you'll still have to store the token in the environment variables.

There's also a script for a worker you can run to do background tasks like image processing by typing in `node worker.js`, but you need a CloudAMQP instance to do so.

## Environment Variables

Here's a list of tokens you can set up in system variables to bring more functionality to Poopy:
  - `AUTH_TOKEN` (SET THIS TO SOMETHING COMPLETELY RANDOM! mainly used for encrypting/decrypting messages and private tokens from people, can also be used to access private apis from the website)
  - `BOT_WEBSITE` (url if you want a website for your bot)
  - `HIVEMIND_ID` (id for your bot to participate in the hivemind. leave blank to not have any of the hivemind functionality)
  - `CLOUDAMQP_URL` (url used to send file processing queues, accessed at https://api.cloudamqp.com/console/`APP-ID`/details)
  - `MONGOOSE_URL` (url used to access the database, generated at https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/`PROJECT-ID`#clusters/connect)
  - `AI21_KEY` (key generated when you sign up in ai21 for generating text, accessed at https://studio.ai21.com/account/account)
  - `GOOGLE_KEY` (key from google cloud for accessing the youtube api, generated at https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=`PROJECT-ID`)
  - `MAKESWEET_KEY` (key from makesweet for generating heartlocket gifs, dm @mkswt on twitter asking for one)
  - `RANDOMSTUFF_KEY` (key used for a cleverbot alternative when it breaks, generated at https://api-info.pgamerx.com/manage-key)
  - `RAPIDAPI_KEY` (key from rapid api when you sign up, accessed at https://rapidapi.com/developer/security/`APP-NAME`)
